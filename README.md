The android component of our ethical shopping app
<h1>Installation</h1>
To install and run the application, download or clone the project and import it into Android Studio. Run the project on an emulator or on an attached device. 

<h1>Using the App</h1>
This application is only a prototype. The barcode scanner can be accessed from the homepage, and is simulates a real barcode scanner by capturing a photo and redirecting the user to the demo product overview screen

You may also search the available demo products and interact with the modals used to add sources and share to social media.

Not all source links are clickable, however the Starbucks Coffee example overview page contains an example of a clickable source link.
